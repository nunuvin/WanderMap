It was made with Gemini Pro.

## Run locally

No build step is required.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

If your browser blocks some local iframe behaviors, run a simple static server instead:

```bash
cd WanderMap
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
